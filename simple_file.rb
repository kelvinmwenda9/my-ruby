# object.class i.e. 100.classs = Integer
# 100.next = 101
# -100.abs = 100


# String interpolation - e.g. msg = 'I loove you' - puts "I just called to say: #{msg}."
# / escaping
# \t new tab  \n  new line

# Array - ordered, integer-indexed collection of objects
# empty_array = []
# my_array = ['a','b','c', 100]
# arrays can be added together
# array methods
# Hash - unordered, object-indexed collection of objects (key value pairs)
# symbos lioke strings but cannot be edited
#  symbols are used to name values in hashes
# not editable
# allow ruby to better manage the resources, refer to only one symbol and is not copied multiple times
# hash symbol shorthand - separate keys and values using colon, e.g. scores = {low: 2, high:10, avg: 6}
# boolean - an object tha can either be true or false
# inclusive range e.g. 1..10 last number included
# exclusive range 1...10 last number is excluded

# constants used to store values that are constants, they are named by defining them in capital letters
# NIL is ab object, nil is not false, it means nothing
# colons are always pre-followed by non-integers
